# FEDERATION STARSHIP REGISTRY

## Code Kentucky C# Final Project

This app allows for a GUI search from a CSV database of vessels and starbases from the Star Trek Universe. The program begins with a few dozen Starships in the database but also allows for the addition of more ships by the user.

## *PLEASE READ
For the best experience using this app, I recommend you install the font called "Antonio-VariableFont_wght" in the main directory of this repo. To install a font, just right-click on the font file and choose "Install". 

## Using the Starship Registry

Users will be met with this "LCARS Network Access" age, which is sort of like a login page. Enter your name and press enter (or the "SECURE LOG IN" button to continue.

The user will then be greeted with the main "LCARS Database" screen. From there it is possible to navigate to different areas of the application.
